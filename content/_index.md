My name is Matt and I make computers do things. **Full-stack web development** is where most of my professional time has been spent. Below are some of the technologies I've used to build solutions for individuals, small businesses, and large corporations. 

If you'd like to work together, don't hesitate to [reach out](/#contact).

## Web
Getting content from one computer to another, anywhere. The tools and frameworks for getting this done are getting faster and more resilient everyday. I originally started on a **Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP** stack. The classic and still widely used **LAMP** stack. **Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla**, and other content management systems (**CMS**) leverage this stack. 

**Flat file CMS (grav, pico)** platforms are another interesting choice because of their simplicity. There is no database to manage your content. The filesystem is the database and the content is written in **Markdown**. 

Even simpler is using a **static site generator (hugo, jekyll)**.  Static sites can be hosted anywhere a web server is running and for very cheap, sometimes even free.  They are also incredibly secure due to the reduced attack surface.

When developing enterprise **web applications** and **middleware**, I've leaned on Microsoft's **ASP.NET framework** and **Node.js**.

## APIs
**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterfaces are the glue that holds together a data rich application. We can use APIs to integrate data from several different sources to **action any task from any application** or **enable automation of a task**. 
- CRM (Salesforce)
- Helpdesk Ticketing (ServiceNow, Jira)
- Logistics (SAP, Descartes)
- ERP (SAP)
- Weather, Finance, News, Social Media
- Data Scraping
- GPT-3 natural language tasks (AI Chat bot, Create Copy, Auto Summarize, and more.)

## Automation
The key to [reducing toil](https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/) is the introduction of automation. If a task is repeatable then it can be done by a computer. Automation reduces mistakes and increases productivity.

- Background Jobs (cron, Hangfire)
- Onboarding
- Alerts
- Data Migration
- Data Validation
- Data Sync
